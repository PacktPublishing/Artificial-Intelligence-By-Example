# Artificial Intelligence By Example
This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788990547), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Artificial Intelligence by Example is your starting point to understanding how AI is built with the help of intriguing examples. Your will focus on how to become an adaptive thinker and understand the relationship between the concepts explained in the book and real-life situations. Using some of the best AI examples right from a simple chess engine to a cognitive chatbot, you will learn how to tackle a machine you are competing with. You will learn about advanced machine learning models, how to apply AI to blockchain and IoT, and develop the emotional quotient in chatbots using neural networks. You will focus more on how you can design the AI solution easily rather than complex machine learning and deep learning techniques. Artificial Intelligence by Example will be a starter kit for you to develop AI applications on your own.
## Instructions and Navigation
